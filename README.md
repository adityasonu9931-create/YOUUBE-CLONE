## 🎯 Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization
- Large bundle size
- No lazy loading
- Poor mobile experience
- No error handling
- Basic loading states

### After Optimization
- ✅ Reduced bundle size with code splitting
- ✅ Lazy loading for images and components
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design
- ✅ Comprehensive error boundaries
- ✅ Skeleton loading states
- ✅ Optimized re-renders with React.memo
- ✅ Debounced search functionality
- ✅ Intersection observer for lazy loading

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Breakpoints
Update `tailwind.config.js` to add custom breakpoints:
```javascript
screens: {
  'xs': '475px',
  'sm': '640px',
  'md': '768px',
  'lg': '1024px',
  'xl': '1280px',
  '2xl': '1536px',
}
```

### Custom Animations
Add custom animations in `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
animation: {
  'fade-in': 'fadeIn 0.5s ease-in-out',
  'slide-up': 'slideUp 0.3s ease-out',
}
```

## 📱 Mobile Features

- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Swipe or tap to open/close
- **Mobile Search**: Full-screen search overlay
- **Touch Gestures**: Optimized for touch interactions
- **Responsive Video Player**: Adapts to screen size
- **Mobile-First Grid**: Flexible card layouts
